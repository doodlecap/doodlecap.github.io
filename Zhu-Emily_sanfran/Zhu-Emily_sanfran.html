            There are a <em>lot</em> of shops on Geary that I enjoy visiting. It has a good diversity of <strong>food</strong> and there are various entertainments nearby them, making it a good hangout spot.

            There isn't a lot to do here. The shops keep closing down and being replaced so there's always a different experience when visiting but it's annoying because they're not refreshing surprises.
